# Description
This notebook scraps a famous Spanish Car Listing website using `Beautiful Soup` and stores the data into a `.csv` file.

Even though the website announces to have more than 100k car listings, after trying to scrape car number 10.000 (page=626), the webpage shows an error. This is why only 625 pages can be scrapped.

# Installation
A `cars_scrapping.yaml` is provided in 'scrapping_cnet` folder to run this notebook.
